# **<span style="color:DarkRed">Facial Expression Recognition:</span>**

## **<span style="color:FireBrick">Intro:</span>**
**This repository contains the code for my facial expression recognition project, which was developed as part of my internship with Code Clause AI. The project aims to accurately classify facial expressions and emotions using deep learning techniques.**

## **<span style="color:red">Key Features:</span>**

1. **Facial Expression Classification**: The project leverages deep learning models to classify facial expressions into different emotion categories, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc. This allows for real-time analysis and understanding of people's emotions based on their facial expressions.

2. **Deep Learning Model**: The project utilizes a state-of-the-art deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to capture spatial and temporal features from facial images or video sequences.

3. **Real-time Emotion Detection**: The developed system can perform real-time emotion detection by capturing and analyzing facial expressions from live video streams or webcam input. This feature enables applications such as emotion-aware interfaces, sentiment analysis, and personalized user experiences.

4. **Data Augmentation**: The project includes data augmentation techniques, such as random rotation, and flipping, are employed to increase the diversity and robustness of the training data.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The repository provides scripts and tools for training the facial expression recognition model using annotated datasets. It also includes evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the trained model, such as accuracy, Confusion matrix.

6. **Documentation and Usage Guide**: The repository includes comprehensive documentation and a usage guide that provides clear instructions on how to set up the project, train the model, perform inference, and utilize the facial expression recognition system in different contexts.
